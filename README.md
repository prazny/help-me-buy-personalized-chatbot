## About Project

Project made during studies in web technologies.

The backend is written in Laravel and the frontend in React + Refine.


### What have I learned?

I learned a few design patterns.

- Factory method
- Chain of Responsibility

I also learned to work 10 hours a day for 5 days. It wasn't necessarily a nice study. :upside_down_face:
